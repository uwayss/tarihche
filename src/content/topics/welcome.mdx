<Section title="What Tarihche Is">

Tarihche is a content-driven study interface. The content lives as **portable MDX** files, and the UI is composed from reusable educational components.

<NoteBox title="Goal">
  Turn a linear textbook into modular sections that are easy to navigate,
  collapse, and present.
</NoteBox>

<Section title="How Content and UI Stay Separate" defaultOpen={false}>

Content (MDX) focuses on meaning and structure:

- sections
- key terms
- cause ↔ effect
- timelines

The application code handles layout, navigation, reading mode, and annotations.
